% TestPredictedZ = PCDOC_predict(pcdocModel, TestP)
%
% DESCRIPTION: 
%   This function uses the pcdocModel for predicting Z (latent
%   representation) of paterns TestP
% INPUT: 
%   - pcdocModel: trained model
%   - TestP: patterns attributes
%   - TestT: patterns labels
% OUTPUT: 
%   - TestPredictedZ: 

function TestPredictedY = PCDOC_predict(pcdocModel, TestP, Q)

    DummyTestT = rand(size(TestP,1),1);

    % svmpredict needs TestT
    TestPredictedZ = ...
                    svmpredict(DummyTestT, TestP, pcdocModel.svrmodel);

    TestPredictedY = PCDOC_classify(TestPredictedZ, pcdocModel.T, Q);

    %TestPredictedY = TestPredictedY';
        
end
