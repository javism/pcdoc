% Y = PCDOC_classify(Z, pcdocModel.T, Q)
%
% DESCRIPTION: 
%   This function uses Z latent representation and thressholds for classifying 
%   patterns according to they latent representation.
% INPUT: 
%   - Z: patterns latent representation
%   - T: thressholds
%   - Q: number of classes
% OUTPUT: 
%   - Y: predicted patterns labels

function Y = PCDOC_classify(Z, T, Q)

    Y = zeros(size(Z));
    
    for ii=1:Q-1
        
        if (ii == 1)
            indx = Z<=T(ii);
        else
            indx = and(Z>T(ii-1), Z<=T(ii));
        end

        Y(indx) = ii;
    end
    
    % last class
    indx = Z>T(Q-1);
    Y(indx) = Q;
    
end
