% DESCRIPTION: 
%   This function implements the Pairwise Class Distances projection.
%   The distances calculation code is not optimized, however, it is more
%   understable in the way it is writed. 
% INPUT: 
%   - X: patterns attributes
%   - Y: patterns class labels
%   - Q: number of classes
% OUTPUT: 
%   - Z: the PCD projection (latent representation). 
%   - ZC: the PCD projection separated for each class
%   - Dmin,DminIdx,Ztemp,NC: are returning for teaching purposes, such as
%   for the projection analysis.
