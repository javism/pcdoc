% DESCRIPTION: 
%   This function uses the pcdocModel for predicting Z (latent
%   representation) of paterns TestP
% INPUT: 
%   - pcdocModel: trained model
%   - TestP: patterns attributes
% OUTPUT: 
%   - pcdocModel: trained regression model and thressholds
%   - TrainPredictedY: 

function [pcdocModel, TrainPredictedY] = PCDOC_train(TrainP, TrainT, Q, hyperparam)

    pcdocModel.svrhyperparam = hyperparam;
    %% PCD projection
    % width 
    width = 1/Q;
    % maximum Z value
    maxZ = 1;
    % Thressholds used for classification purposes when predicting
    % new values of Z for unseen data. 
    pcdocModel.T = width:width:maxZ;

    % Calculate the projection
    TrainZ = pcdprojection(TrainP,TrainT,Q);

    %% e-SVR training
    svrParameters = ...
        ['-s 3 -t 2 -c ' num2str(hyperparam.c) ' -p ' num2str(hyperparam.e) ...
        ' -g ' num2str(hyperparam.k)];

    pcdocModel.svrmodel = svmtrain(TrainZ, TrainP, svrParameters);
    [TrainPredictedZ] = ...
