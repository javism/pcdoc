% pm = PCDOC_performanceMetrics(Y, PredY)
%
% DESCRIPTION: 
%   This function calculates son ordinal classification performance metrics.
% INPUT: 
%   - Y: target class labels
%   - PredY: predicted class labels
% OUTPUT: 
%   - pm: structure containing Acc, MAE, AMAE and Kendall's Tau performance metrics

function pm = PCDOC_performanceMetrics(Y, PredY)

    pm.confMatrix = confmat(Y,PredY);

    % Acc
    pm.acc = ccr(pm.confMatrix);

    % MAE
    pm.mae = mae(pm.confMatrix);

    % AMAE
    pm.amae = amae(pm.confMatrix);

    % Kendalls Tau
    pm.kendall = tkendall(Y, PredY);

end
