% DESCRIPTION: 
%   Load, standarize train+test dataset and extract dataset information
% INPUT: 
%   - trainFileName: train set file name
%   - testFilename: test set file name
% OUTPUT: 
%   - DataSet: structure containing the preprocessed dataset patterns and
%   some useful information (i.e. number of classes, number of patterns).
